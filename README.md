# scikit-hubness

`scikit-hubness` provides tools for the analysis and
reduction of hubness in high-dimensional data.
Hubness is an aspect of the _curse of dimensionality_
and is detrimental to many machine learning and data mining tasks.

The `skhubness.analysis` and `skhubness.reduction` packages allow to

- analyze, whether your data sets show hubness
- reduce hubness via a variety of different techniques
- perform downstream analysis (performance assessment) with `scikit-learn`
  due to compatible data structures

The `skhubness.neighbors` package provides approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)
search. This is compatible with scikit-learn classes and functions relying
on neighbors graphs due to compliance with [KNeighborsTransformer](
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#neighbors-transformer) APIs
and data structures. Using ANN can speed up many scikit-learn classification,
clustering, embedding and other methods, including:
- [KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier)
- [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html#sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN)
- [TSNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html#sklearn.manifold.TSNE)
- and many more.

`scikit-hubness` thus provides
- _approximate nearest neighbor_ search
- hubness reduction
- and combinations,

which allows for fast hubness-reduced neighbor search in large datasets
(tested with >1M objects).


## Installation

Make sure you have a working Python3 environment (at least 3.8).

Use pip to install the latest stable version of `scikit-hubness` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install scikit-hubness
```

NOTE: v0.30 is currently under development and not yet available on PyPI.
Install from sources to obtain the bleeding edge version.

Dependencies are installed automatically, if necessary.
`scikit-hubness` is based on the SciPy-stack, including `numpy`, `scipy` and `scikit-learn`.
Approximate nearest neighbor search and approximate hubness reduction
additionally require at least one of the following packages:
* [`nmslib`](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib)
    for hierachical navigable small-world graphs in `skhubness.neighbors.NMSlibTransformer`
* [`ngtpy`](https://github.com/yahoojapan/NGT/)
    for nearest neighbor graphs (ANNG, ONNG) in `skhubness.neighbors.NGTTransformer`
* [`puffinn`](https://github.com/puffinn/puffinn)
    for locality-sensitive hashing in `skhubness.neighbors.PuffinnTransformer`
* [`annoy`](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
    for random projection forests in `skhubness.neighobrs.AnnoyTransformer`
* Additional ANN libraries might be added in future releases. Please reach out to us in a Github Issue,
  if you think a specific library is missing (pull requests welcome).

For more details and alternatives, please see the [Installation instructions](
http://scikit-hubness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html).

## Documentation

Additional documentation is available online:

## What's new

See the [changelog](docs/changelog.md) to find what's new in the latest package version.

 
## Quickstart

Users of `scikit-hubness` may want to 

1. analyse, whether their data show hubness
2. reduce hubness
3. perform learning (classification, regression, ...)

The following example shows all these steps for an example dataset
from the text domain (dexter). (Please make sure you have installed `scikit-hubness`).

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, KNeighborsTransformer

from skhubness import Hubness
from skhubness.data import load_dexter
from skhubness.neighbors import NMSlibTransformer
from skhubness.reduction import MutualProximity


# load the example dataset 'dexter' that is embedded in a
# high-dimensional space, and could, thus, be prone to hubness.
X, y = load_dexter()
print(f'X.shape = {X.shape}, y.shape = {y.shape}')

# assess the actual degree of hubness in dexter
hub = Hubness(k=10, metric='cosine')
hub.fit(X)
k_skew = hub.score()
print(f'Skewness = {k_skew:.3f}')

# additional hubness indices are available, for example:
hub = Hubness(k=10, return_value="all", metric='cosine')
scores = hub.fit(X).score()
print(f'Robin hood index:   {scores.get("robinhood"):.3f}')
print(f'Antihub occurrence: {scores.get("antihub_occurrence"):.3f}')
print(f'Hub occurrence:     {scores.get("hub_occurrence"):.3f}')

# There is considerable hubness in dexter. Let's see, whether 
# hubness reduction can improve kNN classification performance.
# We first create a kNN graph:
knn = KNeighborsTransformer(n_neighbors=50, metric="cosine")
# Alternatively, create an approximate KNeighborsTransformer, e.g.,
# knn = NMSlibTransformer(n_neighbors=50, metric="cosine")
kneighbors_graph = knn.fit_transform(X, y)

# vanilla kNN without hubness reduction
clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric='precomputed')
acc_standard = cross_val_score(clf, kneighbors_graph, y, cv=5)

# kNN with hubness reduction (mutual proximity) reuses the
# precomputed graph and works in sklearn workflows:
mp = MutualProximity(method="normal")
mp_graph = mp.fit_transform(kneighbors_graph)
acc_mp = cross_val_score(clf, mp_graph, y, cv=5)

print(f'Accuracy (vanilla kNN): {acc_standard.mean():.3f}')
print(f'Accuracy (kNN with hubness reduction): {acc_mp.mean():.3f}')

# Accuracy was considerably improved by mutual proximity.
# Did it actually reduce hubness?
mp_scores = hub.fit(mp_graph).score()
print(f'k-skewness after MP: {mp_scores.get("k_skewness"):.3f} '
      f'(reduction of {scores.get("k_skewness") - mp_scores.get("k_skewness"):.3f})')
print(f'Robinhood after MP:  {mp_scores.get("robinhood"):.3f} '
      f'(reduction of {scores.get("robinhood") - mp_scores.get("robinhood"):.3f})')
```
